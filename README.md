# URLshorteningApp

Have you ever wondered how people create URL shortening websites. They just do it using common sense. You heard it right. I too thought it is a very big task. But after thinking a bit, I came to know that simple mathematical concepts can be used in writing beautiful applications

I here interested only in Base62 because I need to generate strings which are combinations of [a-z][A-Z][0-9].  Encoder maps integer to a string. Decoder generates integer from given string.  They are like Function and Reverse Functions. This is the Base62 code for encoder and decoder in Python.
